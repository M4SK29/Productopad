# Productopad
My macropad for productivity, allowing to open and close apps at the click of buttons!

## Notes
1. I'll not be attaching the 4 pin headers themselves to the pcb but will use their holes and solder my cables to them to make it easier.
2. The platform sorta thing you see on the design is the place for the 0.91 inch oled. tightly fitted, yes and I won't be putting headers on that either I'll just solder the cables to the holes.
3. To fix the screen to the platform I'll probably just hotglue it. It's convenient and can be removed when needed then.
4. Yes the code is written by ChatGPT, so I'll probably have to edit it and make it work when I receive the parts.

## Case and it's parts

This is the base of it and

this is the top

I will connect the cables for the OLED screen and glue it to the sort of platform I've made. It will be a tight fit so I may even not need to use the glue. The top will then be put on with nut and bolts or whatever they provide in the kit for it. That's pretty much it for putting the things in the case and like I said I'll be soldering the cables for the display and not use the headers(4 pin ones)
